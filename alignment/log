 alignment                       Analyses used to validate the correctness and performance the BWA Java bindings.
   Align                         Aligns reads to a given reference using Heng Li's BWA aligner, presenting the resulting 
                                 alignments in SAM or BAM format.
   AlignmentValidation           Validates consistency of the aligner interface by taking reads already aligned by BWA 
                                 in a BAM file, stripping them of their alignment data, realigning them, and making sure 
                                 one of the best resulting realignments matches the original alignment from the input 
                                 file.
